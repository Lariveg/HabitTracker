This is project is done for the Android Basics Nanodegree with Udacity. 

The project is about setting up and using the database schema for a simple habit tracking app. This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills. They include:
- Creating a SQLite table in your app
- Populating that table with new entries
- Modifying the entries
- Displaying the contents of the table to users.

I put some screenshots with how the app looks in the screenshots directory.
